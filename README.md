# DevSecOps helper
when I wanted to create my secure pipeline for the DevSecOps process with concentrated on Jenkins as an automation tool and DefectDoJo as a vulnerability management tools(VMS), I confront some problems in this process. for example DefectDoJo needs just one special format report from my tools like XML report of Acunetix(DAST tools) and HTML report of Sonarqube with security plugins (SAST tools). in a normal process, we don't have these types of format reports in our automation process. That's why I have to develop these codes for solving my problems. I wrote two steps in codes. In the first step, we export XML report from Acunetix, or HTML report from Sonarqube and then import them on the Defectdojo profile.
