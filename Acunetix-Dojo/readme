as you know, DefectDojo just needs XML format report of Acunetix scanner and with normal process you can export pdf report between Acunetix and Jenkins. because of this problem I wrote this code for easy integration between Jenkins, Acunetix, and Defectdojo for the DAST step in my secure pipeline. 
if you need to use this code, at first you must fill my code with your correct production data and run this script at the end of your pipeline.
